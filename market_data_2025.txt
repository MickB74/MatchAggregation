Based on current market data for late 2024 and 2025 in the ERCOT North region, here are realistic PPA prices for each technology in your scenario configuration.
Summary of Recommended Updates
Your current config values for Solar and Wind ($30) are too low for new 2025 contracts. Your Battery and Nuclear prices are reasonable but require context, while your CCS price is conservative (high) if you account for tax credits.
Technology	Your Config Price	Realistic Market Price (2025)	Unit	Notes
Solar	$30.0	$45.00 – $52.00	$/MWh	Prices have stabilized but remain elevated due to financing costs.
Wind	$30.0	$40.00 – $45.00	$/MWh	Wind PPA prices in ERCOT have risen due to scarcity of new high-quality sites.
Battery	$10.0	$8.00 – $12.00	$/kW-mo	Spot revenues crashed in 2024 (~$4.60/kW-mo), but fixed contracts (tolls) still command a premium for certainty.
Geothermal	$80.0	$70.00 – $85.00	$/MWh	Based on recent US PPAs (e.g., Fervo Energy in CA/NV). Texas projects (e.g., Presidio) likely fall in this range for early adopters.
Nuclear	$80.0	$90.00 – $100.00+	$/MWh	For new SMR capacity. Existing nuclear doesn't typically sign new PPAs, but new builds are expensive ($100+ without heavy subsidy).
CCS (Gas)	$100.0	$55.00 – $75.00	$/MWh	Assuming 45Q tax credits. Unsubsidized, your $100 is accurate. With credits, new NGCC+CCS can be competitive.[1]
REC Price	$8.0	$2.00 – $4.00	$/MWh	Generic Texas wind/solar RECs (Green-e) are abundant and cheap. $8 is high unless it's a specific compliance product.
Detailed Market Context
1. Solar PV ($45 - $52/MWh)
Market Reality: While module prices have dropped, higher interest rates and interconnection costs in ERCOT North have kept PPA offer prices in the high $40s to low $50s.
Trend: Prices stabilized in late 2024 after rising for two years. Competition in ERCOT North is high, but $30/MWh is no longer achievable for new build contracts.
2. Onshore Wind ($40 - $45/MWh)
Market Reality: Wind prices have crept up.[2] Finding unconstrained interconnection capacity in the North hub is difficult, driving a premium for projects that can actually deliver there.
Trend: Wind is increasingly valued for its generation profile complementary to solar (generating more at night/evening), which supports a price floor around $40.
3. Battery Storage ($8 - $12/kW-month)
Pricing Structure: Batteries typically sign "Tolling Agreements" priced in $/kW-month, not $/MWh.
Market Reality: 2024 was a brutal year for battery revenue in ERCOT, with average realized revenues dropping to ~$55/kW-year (approx. $4.60/kW-month) due to market saturation.
Contract vs. Spot: despite low spot revenues, a fixed price PPA/Toll transfers risk to the offtaker. Developers will not finance new projects for $4.60/kW-mo. A realistic "bankable" tolling fee to get a project built is likely $8 - $10/kW-month. Your $10 value is realistic for a contract, even if current market revenue is lower.
4. Geothermal ($70 - $85/MWh)
Market Reality: Texas is seeing emerging activity (e.g., the Presidio project), but commercial price data is scarce.
Benchmark: Recent commercial Geothermal PPAs in California (like Fervo Energy's deal with SCE) are priced around $68 - $75/MWh. Given Texas's drilling expertise but lack of state-level mandates compared to CA, $80 is a very solid, realistic estimate for a "First-of-a-Kind" commercial project.
5. Nuclear ($90 - $100+/MWh)
Market Reality: This price refers to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) or new builds, as existing plants are fully depreciated.
Cost: First-of-a-kind SMR estimates often exceed $100/MWh. However, with the InflationReductionAct(IRA)productiontaxcredits(PTC),theeffectivePPApriceforanofftakercouldbebroughtdowntothe$80-$90 range. Your $80 is optimistic but plausible if assuming mature supply chains or maximum subsidies.
6. CCS (Natural Gas with Carbon Capture) ($55 - $75/MWh)
Market Reality: A standard Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) runs ~$35-$45/MWh (fuel dependent). Adding Carbon Capture (CCS) adds Capex and efficiency losses.
Impact of Policy: The 45Q tax credit (up to $85/ton of CO2) significantly offsets the cost. With 45Q, an NGCC+CCS plant can offer power at $55-$75/MWh. Without the tax credit, the cost would indeed be $100/MWh.
Recommendation: If your scenario assumes US federal tax credits apply, lower this to ~$65.
7. REC Prices ($2 - $4/MWh)
Market Reality: ERCOT does not have a tight mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) driving prices up (unlike NEPOOL where RECs can be $30+). Texas RECs are primarily "voluntary" (Green-e).[3]
Price: Supply of wind/solar RECs in Texas is massive. Prices for 2024/2025 vintages are typically $2.00 - $3.50/MWh. $8.00 is an outlier unless you are modeling a specific scarcity scenario or a "bundled" premium product.
